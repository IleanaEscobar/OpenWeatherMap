# How to contribute:
We're glad you're thinking about contributing! Here are a few guidelines to get you started.

## Things to keep in mind

### Be nice
Be nice to other people here. Racism, sexism, etc. are not tolerated anywhere on this repository.

### Use issues and PRs
Notice a problem with the code, or want to suggest an enhancement? Create an issue. And of course, code should be added with a pull request. Also, write detailed and thoughtful commit messages, issue descriptions, etc.â€”at least if you have any intention for other people to read them.

### Test your code
Before submitting any PR, please try to test your code a little. Formal tests aren't required, but please do not submit PRs with obvious syntax errors or that have obviously not been run even once.

Additionally, as much as possible, please try to avoid making PRs that cause merge conflicts. If the repository has updated since you last pulled, use git rebase to fix that.

### Where do I start?
If you want to contribute, but don't know what to do, start by looking at the issues. Issues marked with "good first issue" are a good place to start. If you have questions about a particular issue, you can post them in the discussion under the issue.

## Repository philosophy:

We touched on this briefly in the 'be nice' section, but feel it is important we clarify that this repository is meant to be an inclusive, safe space where anyone can feel comfortable contributing to. You will notice that the main branch is named 'main' and not 'master'. This is intentional and meant to contribute to doing better with code inclusivity and straying away from terms with conotations of hate and exclusivity (again this repository is meant ot be a safe space for everyone). If you see anything in our code that you feel goes against this policy please feel free to create an issue and we will try our best to look into it as fast as possible.
